**Hand Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV**

**Description**
This Python script utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for webcam handling and image manipulation. It detects hands in real-time from a webcam feed, and the landmarks are visualized on the video stream.

**Installation**
1. Install MediaPipe for Python using pip:
2. Install OpenCV:

**Usage:**
